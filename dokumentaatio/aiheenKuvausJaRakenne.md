Project theme: Problem Machine is a program designed to automatically create exercises for physics, math and chemistry, which the program then displays to the user to solve at his/her leisure. The program can be asked to provide answers to the exercises it creates with work and answers shown to the user.

The exercises will have a slightly silly twist to them, with conventional objects found in similar questions being replaced with elephants, killer robots, and other nonsense in the same vein.

Users: Student/Teacher

Operations for all users:

- Choose question theme and subject (math/physics/chemistry)
- Ask for a new question from the machine
- Ask if an answer is the correct one for the question at hand
- Ask for the answer from the machine to the current question
- Ask for the calculations needed to reach the answer

(-possibly slider/option to choose difficulty of questions)
(-click a button that displays a funny joke for a moment to distract you from your work)
