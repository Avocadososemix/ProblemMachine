Problem Machine is a program designed to automatically create exercises for physics, math and chemistry, which the program then displays to the user to solve at his/her leisure. The program can be asked to provide answers to the exercises it creates with work and answers shown to the user.

The exercises will have a slightly silly twist to them, with conventional objects found in similar questions being replaced with elephants, killer robots, and other nonsense in the same vein.
